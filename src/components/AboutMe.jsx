              As a full-stack developer with a degree from the University of
              Engineering and Technology Mardan, I am driven by a passion for
              creating innovative web applications. My academic background has
              provided me with a solid understanding of software engineering
              principles and a keen eye for detail in both front-end and
              back-end development.

              During my studies, I gained hands-on experience with technologies
              like React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. These tools have
              allowed me to build dynamic, responsive user interfaces and
              efficient, scalable server-side applications. Iâ€™ve worked on
              several projects that have sharpened my problem-solving skills and
              deepened my understanding of web development.
